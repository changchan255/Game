# Introduction
* A clone of Flappy Bird -  a hit's game developed by Nguyen Ha Dong in 2013 - using C++ and [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).

_*The resources used in the game are collected from the Internet and most of them have been edited to suit the property of the game._

# Gameplay
* Flappy Bird was a side-scrolling game featuring 2D retro style graphics. The objective was to direct a flying bird, named "Faby", who moves continuously to the right, between sets of Mario-like pipes. If the player touches the pipes, they lose. Faby briefly flaps upward each time that the player taps the screen; if the screen is not tapped, Faby falls because of gravity; each pair of pipes that he/she navigates between earns the player a single point.
* There is no variation or evolution in gameplay throughout the game, as the pipes always have the same gap between them and there is no end to the running track, having only the flap and ding sounds and the rising score as rewards.

 ## How to play
 * Press <b>SPACE / UP key</b> to play.
